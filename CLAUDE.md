# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Host Reservation Panel is a React/TypeScript application for managing Airbnb and Booking.com reservations. It uses AI to extract data from uploaded files (CSV, images, PDFs) and provides dashboard analytics and forecasting capabilities.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Environment Setup

The application requires a Gemini API key for AI processing:
- Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local` file
- The API key is exposed as `process.env.API_KEY` in the build via Vite config

## Core Architecture

### File Processing Flow
1. **CSV Files**: Parsed locally using custom Airbnb CSV parser in `App.tsx:32-112`
2. **Images/PDFs**: Processed via Google Gemini AI with structured JSON response schema
3. **Data Validation**: Platform and status validation occurs in `App.tsx:167-182`
4. **Deduplication**: Uses platform-id composite key to prevent duplicates in `App.tsx:192-197`

### Data Models
- **Reservation**: Core data type with platform, guest info, dates, pricing
- **Status Enum**: `'OK' | 'Cancellata' | 'Mancata presentazione'`
- **Platform**: `'Booking.com' | 'Airbnb'`
- **MonthlyBreakdown**: Analytics aggregation by month and platform

### Component Architecture
- **App.tsx**: Main state management and file processing logic
- **Dashboard**: Primary view with stats and file upload
- **ForecastingAssistant**: AI-powered forecasting and pricing recommendations
- **MonthlySummaryTable**: Financial analytics breakdown
- **FileUpload**: Drag-and-drop file processing interface

### State Management
- React hooks-based state in App.tsx
- Key states: `reservations`, `isLoading`, `error`, `processingFileNames`
- View switching between 'dashboard' and 'forecast' modes

## AI Integration

### Gemini AI Processing
- Uses `@google/genai` package for image/PDF analysis
- Structured response schema with TypeScript type validation
- Prompts specifically designed for Airbnb/Booking.com data extraction
- Base64 file encoding for multimodal input processing

### CSV Processing
- Custom parser for Italian Airbnb exports
- Date format conversion from DD/MM/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD
- Price parsing with Euro symbol and comma decimal handling
- Guest description concatenation from separate adult/child/infant columns

## Development Notes

### Path Aliases
- `@/*` resolves to project root via Vite config
- TypeScript configured for React JSX and ES2022 target

### Data Flow
1. Files uploaded â†’ `handleProcessFiles` in App.tsx
2. CSV files processed locally, others via AI
3. Results merged and deduplicated
4. State updated and dashboard refreshed
5. View automatically switches to dashboard after processing

### Key Features
- Multi-file upload support (CSV, images, PDFs)
- Real-time processing status with file names
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Platform-specific data extraction and validation
- Monthly financial analytics and forecasting
